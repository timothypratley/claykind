One thing I love about Clojure is that it allows me to change functions on the fly.
The Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) becomes a trusted companion, a real-time feedback mechanism,
and a dynamic environment fostering experimentation and rapid iteration.
But I'm not usually "in" the REPL.
I'm "in" my editor, sending forms to the REPL.
Evaluating Expressions at the cursor,
running tests, navigating, and viewing docstrings or parameter lists.

A common scenario I find myself in is that I set up a little bit of code to try something.
Then I make some changes, and need to retry the same snippet or test.
In the meantime I have navigated away and I need to either go back to the form I am interested in,
or navigate to the REPL and use history to try it again.
Both of these strategies work, but there is a better way!

ðŸ’¡
The idea is to create a REPL command that creates a function in the `user` namespace.
Then we can make a keybinding like "send form before caret to REPL",
and another keybinding to execute the saved function.
That way even if we send other forms to the REPL,
we can conveniently retry the snippet we are focused on.

Here is how I set the "try" command up:
![img](try-form-before-caret.png)

I use Cursive Clojure (IntelliJ).
If you use a different editor, you can find instructions for creating key bound commands
in the [Clay setup documentation](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/#setup).

`~form-before-caret` gets replaced with code.

So if our cursor is at the end of an expression, the `_` below:

```clojure
(+ 1 2)_
```

My editor will send the following code to the REPL:

```clojure
(do (intern 'user 'retry (fn retry []
                           (+ 1 2)))
    (user/retry))
```

This creates the `retry` var in the `user` namespace (`user/retry`),
and assigns it to a function that will run the code I am interested in.

It is worth considering a few questions about namespaces at this point.
*Which namespace will the command execute in?*
*How can `user/retry` "see" variables in the currently edited namespace?*

The command will execute in the namespace of the file I am editing,
because I configured the command to do so through Cursive.
The function is created in the current namespace, because
`(fn retry [] (+ 1 2))` is eagerly evaluated as an argument to `intern`.
Because the function is created in the current namespace, `x` is resolved correctly.
`user/retry` can be invoked from any namespace by the fully qualified name of the var `user/retry`.

Here is how I set the "retry" command which simply invokes `(user/retry)`:
![img](retry-form.png)

And here are the keybindings for the commands I use:
![img](retry-keybindings.png)

I've bound `alt-z` to **"try form before caret"** and `ctrl-z` to **"retry"**.

Now let's take it for a spin.
Here is some code I've been working on; I'm drawing a heart shape.

```clojure
(def heart-path
  "M 12.0 7.2 C 10.5 5.6 8.1 5.2 6.3 6.7 C 4.5 8.1 4.2 10.6 5.7 12.4 L 12.0 18.3 L 18.3 12.4 C 19.7 10.6 19.5 8.1 17.7 6.7 C 15.8 5.2 13.4 5.6 12.0 7.2 Z")
```

> ```clojure
> "#'try-again/heart-path"
> ```

This shape comes from [svg-paths](https://www.nan.fyi/svg-paths) by [@nandafyi](https://twitter.com/nandafyi).

I'll visualize it in an SVG image:

```clojure
(defn svg [& body]
  (into ^{:kindly/kind :kind/hiccup}
        [:svg {:width   256
               :height  256
               :viewBox [0 0 24 24]
               :xmlns   "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"}]
        body))
```

> ```clojure
> "#'try-again/svg"
> ```

The heart path goes into an SVG element:

```clojure
(defn heart []
  [:path {:fill "green"
          :d    heart-path}])
```

> ```clojure
> "#'try-again/heart"
> ```

And to see what it looks like I'll make a ["rich comment block"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx0-pViyIDU&t=1229s):

```clojure
(comment
  (svg (heart)))
```

The comment block allows me to conveniently send the expression `(svg (heart))` to the REPL,
and of course we'll use my new **"try form before caret"** on it.

```clojure
(svg (heart))
```

<code>[:svg {:width 256, :xmlns &quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;, :viewBox [0 0 24 24], :height 256} [:path {:fill &quot;green&quot;, :d &quot;M 12.0 7.2 C 10.5 5.6 8.1 5.2 6.3 6.7 C 4.5 8.1 4.2 10.6 5.7 12.4 L 12.0 18.3 L 18.3 12.4 C 19.7 10.6 19.5 8.1 17.7 6.7 C 15.8 5.2 13.4 5.6 12.0 7.2 Z&quot;}]]</code>

Now I can navigate throughout my code base, making changes and fixes,
and seeing the effect is just one keystroke away with **"retry"**:

```clojure
(defn heart []
  [:path {:fill "red"
          :d    heart-path}])
```

> ```clojure
> "#'try-again/heart"
> ```

```clojure
(svg (heart))
```

<code>[:svg {:width 256, :xmlns &quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;, :viewBox [0 0 24 24], :height 256} [:path {:fill &quot;red&quot;, :d &quot;M 12.0 7.2 C 10.5 5.6 8.1 5.2 6.3 6.7 C 4.5 8.1 4.2 10.6 5.7 12.4 L 12.0 18.3 L 18.3 12.4 C 19.7 10.6 19.5 8.1 17.7 6.7 C 15.8 5.2 13.4 5.6 12.0 7.2 Z&quot;}]]</code>

Setting up the command to sync all changes before executing makes it easy to test changes as I go,
often I can rely on syncing instead of sending updates to the REPL individually.
